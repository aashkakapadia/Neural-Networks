### Approximation and classification of data sets using neural network models -   
A. Approximation -       
  A.1  Multi Linear perceptron using sigmoidal and bi-sigmoidal activation function.     
  A.2 Radial Basis fnction by pseudo inverse using centres from K-means.      
  A.3 Radial Basis function using gradient descent by minimising least square error.
  
B. Classification -      
  B.1 Multi Linear perceptron using Least square error function.       
  B.2 Multi Linear perceptron using Mean least square error function.      
  B.2 Radial Basis function by pseudo inverse using centres from K-means.      
  B.4 Implementing all above methods after feature reduction using inbuilt PCA function when number of features are much more than number of training data set.
